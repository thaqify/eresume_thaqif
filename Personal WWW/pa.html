		<p>My name is Muhammad Thaqif Bin Yusri Azam. I am 22 years old. I am very eager to achieve my goals in the future and to become a respected professional in one of the fields which i love the most.</p>
	<br>
		<p>I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals.I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.</p>
	<br>
		<p>I appreciate friendship and people who surround me. Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. Iâ€™m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park.</p>
